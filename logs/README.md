# Notes


### Main Libs
   - FFmpeg : to split the video and audio AND to merge the video and audio
   - OpenCV : to process the video for Motion, Text, and Blur Detection
   - Wavelet : to process the audio for Audio De-nosing

### Min Notes
   - FFT is very slow ```O(n)```
   - Wavelet Transform ```O(logn)```
   Wavelet will do the job, for de-noising
   FFmpeg will run inside subprocess module functions

### Need to build
   - Tools : FFmpeg helper, Cache, Logging, Image resizing, etc
